# Rust Notebook

A small repo that has changed a bit too much since I've started it, I mean A
LOT, now this repo is a continuation of a now dead and
 [old rust repository](https://github.com/VentGrey/easy-rust)

In this version I will keep all the exercises inside the same `main.rs` file and
keep the explanaitions in separate jupyter notebooks.

This is still a work in progress.
