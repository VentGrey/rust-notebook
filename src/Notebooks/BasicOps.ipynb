    "#### Bank interest\n",
    "Someone invests money in it's favourite bank and he gets a special monthly interest. Help him with a program that calculates his amount of money by the end of the current month.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need two inputs this time, one for the amount of money and one for the interest rate you wish to calculate, please make sure that you calculate the interest rate with floating point numbers smaller than zero.\n",

    "####  Finance\n",
    "You want to buy a vehicle and the XGW car agency offers you this deal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the amount of money your desired vehicle costs you'll have to pay 35% hitch and the rest of the money can be payed in 18 months maximum.\n",

    "Use your rust skills to make a program that helps you know how much money do you need to pay the hitch and your montly payments.\n",

    "Remember when you wanted that new car? XGW comes with a new offer for you if you thought 18 months was quite a short time to pay a whole car.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can get your car with payments in 36 months with a hitch of 35% but after you pay the hitch every montly payment will receive a 12% interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to take this offer use the power of rust to make a program that helps you calculate your hitch and your montly payments with 12% extra for those darn interests.\n",

    "#### Cone\n",
    "You are eating ice cream and your clumsy hands suddenly make you drop it. In your depressed state you wonder: \"how can I calculate the cone's areas and volume?\" Now you don't have ice cream but you have an assignment, write a rust program that given the radius, the generatrix and the height of a cone, calculate and print the area of the base, the lateral area, the total area and its volume.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Sphere\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you wish to calculate the area and volume of the ice cream sphere you just dropped. So make a program that given a sphere's radius, calculate the sphere's area and volume knowing the following formulas:\n",
    "\n",
    "The area is calculated this way:\n",
    "$ Area = 4 * \\pi * radius^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Volume is calculated this way:\n",
    "$ Vol = \\frac{4}{3} * \\pi * rad ^ 3 $\n",
    "#### Hexaedron\n",

    "Create a program that gives as data the side of a hexahedron or cube, calculate the area of the base, the lateral area, the total area and the volume.\n",
